## CartPole - known also as an Inverted Pendulum

## Power-Gradient Method - REINFORCE

REINFORCE algorithm is based on finding the **local maximum** of a function   
using a procedure known as **gradient ascent**.

## Class Policy

This class implements the simple Convolution Neuron Network (CNN)
model containing only 2 fully-connected levels. In this CNN model, the
function __reinforce()__ approximizes the return value (= sum of all rewards with discounts).
